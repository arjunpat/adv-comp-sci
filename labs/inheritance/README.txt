I did the challenge number 1, which allows you to delete a user.
However, please note that in order for a user to delete a user, they have to open up that user.
Opening up a user is done by searching for the name of a user -> a screen will popup with information about the user and a button to delete.
This is an extra precaution to make sure people don't accidentally delete a user.
